- make the two variables $overlays and $paragraphs actually a key/value map rather than two arrays [why would i do this, idr]
- add roll results to checksuccess and checkfailure somehow?
- add roll results to passive checks?

- make overlays happen AFTER or DURING passive skills being set, rather than before
- tippy...
- why is it tiny???? why is the text tiny????


- modifiers (and listing them in a tippy)?
- xp
- stat setting
- level ups upping stats
- inventory/items
-  bind close to esc key
- thoughts?? (probably not)
- stats don't actually change checks within same passage

DONE
- make "passive skills" actually do a skill check
- got stat changes ui working
- fixed esc key open and close, and added ANOTHER argument to passiveskill
