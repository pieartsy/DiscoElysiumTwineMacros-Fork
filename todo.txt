- add roll results to checksuccess and checkfailure somehow?
- add roll results to passive checks?


- tippy...

- modifiers (and listing them in a tippy)?
- xp
- stat setting
- level ups upping stats
- inventory/items
- thoughts?? (probably not)
- stats don't actually change checks within same passage
- fix display options so when failed flag value is not present it sets to false rather than true
- disable scrolling spacebar

DONE
- make "passive skills" actually do a skill check
- fixed esc key open and close
- why is it tiny???? why is the text tiny???? (fixed)
- redo things using new container widget ability
- bind close to esc key
- make overlays happen AFTER or DURING passive skills being set, rather than before
